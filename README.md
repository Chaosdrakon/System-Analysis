# System-Analysis

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was to make a website that the admins could use to administer tests and to allow students to schedule drive times to assist them in obtaining their licenses. This was meant to be a cloud based system.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel that the diagrams i developed for the DriverPass team is well down and really show in many different ways how they wanted the system to work and how everything interacts with each other through out the different processes.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I feel like the part that needs to be worked on the most was the requirements section of the project. I did feel like i hit the marks on it but to me there is a feeling of still missing out on a lot of details that either were not provided due to the interview process or just things that i would want to add into the requirements to ensure they are covered before they become problems.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When developing any system you need to take users design into consideration because overall it is their system and you need to try and create it as close to how they want it was possible. This is important in the client/developer relationship.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I first look at the overall a design and make diagrams to ensure i understand how all the systems will work together before starting anything. Than i would create each class seperatly to ensure that they work alone and they one by one putting them together to ensure they work and communicate correctly with each other. After each stage i would ensure they work before adding the next section and keep building until everythin was working together sa intended.
